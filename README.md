### How to run
Download the project and run it through your IDE.
```
 git clone https://github.com/AlejandroSilveiraRamos/python-mix-learn
```
Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
###### Developed 4 different applications to learn how they work: 

-  Data analytics
-  Sales forecasting with data science
-  Automation systems and processes 
-  Web automation and information search

#### Data Analysis
##### Challenge

>You work in a telecom company and you have customers for several different services, among the main ones: internet and phone.
>
>The problem is that, analyzing the customer history from the last few years, you have realized that the company is having Churn of more than 26% of the customers.
>
>This represents a loss of millions for the company.
>
>What does the company need to do to solve this?

Step by step to solve the challenge:
  
 1. Import the database to pyhton project
 2. View the database and understand the information available 
 3. Data processing
 4. Initial analysis / global analysis
 5. Detail analysis (Search for the reason/the solotuin of Churn)

#### Data Science Project - Sales Forecast
##### Challenge

>Our Challenge is to be able to predict the sales that we will have in a certain period based on the advertising expenses in the 3 major networks that the Hashtag company invests in: TV, Newspaper and Radio

Step by step to solve the challenge:

 1. Understanding the Challenge
 2. Understanding the Area/Company
 3. Data Extraction/Obtaining
 4. Data Adjustment (Treatment/Cleansing)
 5. Exploratory Analysis
 6. Modeling + Algorithms + Artificial Intelligence
 7. Interpretation of Results

#### System and Process Automation
##### Challenge

>Every day, our system updates the previous day's sales. Your daily job, as an analyst, is to send an e-mail to the board, as soon as you start working, with the invoicing and the amount of products sold the previous day.

Step by step to solve the challenge:

  1. Log into the company system 
  2. Navigate the system until you find the database
  3. Export the sales base
  4. Calculate the indicators 
  5. Send an e-mail to the board with the indicators


#### Web Automation and Information Retrieval
##### Challenge

>We work in an import company and the price of our products is linked to the quotation of:
>
> - Dollar
> - Euro
> - gold
> 
>We need to get on the internet, in an automatic way, the quotation of these 3 items and know how much we should charge for our products, considering a contribution margin that we have in our database.

Step by step to solve the challenge:

  1. Get Dollar scavenging
  2. Get Euro scavenging
  3. Get Gold scavenging
  4. Import the product list
  5. Recalculate the price of each product
  6. Save the new product prices

Important: Download and install Webdriver for your browser.
